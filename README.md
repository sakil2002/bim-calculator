# BMI Checker 

## Project Overview

This project is a **Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator** created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator allows users to input their height and weight, and it calculates their BMI, displaying the result along with a corresponding message indicating whether they are underweight, in the normal range, or overweight.

## Features

- **Height and Weight Input**: Users can enter their height (in centimeters) and weight (in kilograms).
- **BMI Calculation**: The calculator computes the BMI using the formula:
  \[
  \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{(\text{Height (cm)} \times \text{Height (cm)}) / 10000}
  \]
- **Result Display**: The BMI result is displayed in real-time when the user submits the form.
- **Range Indicators**: Based on the calculated BMI:
  - **Underweight**: Displays "Under Weight" with a light blue background.
  - **Normal Range**: Displays "Normal Range" with a light green background.
  - **Overweight**: Displays "Over Weight" with a light coral background.
- **Form Reset**: The reset button clears all inputs and results, returning the form to its original state.

## How to Use

1. Enter your height in centimeters in the "Height" field.
2. Enter your weight in kilograms in the "Weight" field.
3. Click the "Submit" button to calculate your BMI.
4. The BMI and corresponding category will be displayed below the form.
5. To clear the inputs and results, click the "Reset" button.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML5**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: Styling of the form and results.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for calculating BMI and updating the user interface.
